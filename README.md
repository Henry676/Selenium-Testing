# Selenium-Testing

I used Selenium to execute test cases from a shopping website.
The first test case focused on testing the home page to ensure that all DOM elements were correctly positioned and verifying their existence and its functionality. Additionally, I evaluated the website's performance by intentionally introducing errors to observe its behavior.

The second test case involved performing a quick shopping process on the website. I tested whether the entire process functioned as expected, ensuring that the user experience was seamless while following the website's instructions to complete a purchase.
